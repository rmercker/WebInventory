# WebInventory
Web based inventory system

The Photo shows the current, but not completed look of the site. This is just the outline until the current requirements are met.
The system will have several areas one for products, resources, sales, events, and customers. Currently products and resources are
being worked on. The rest are in the back log for now. The web page connects to my oracle db which the table designs are layed out,
but waiting until closer to finishing database logic in the server before working on that.

The site is not available yet as I want to have it functional first. Once I have a base site I will then move to using github for
version control.
